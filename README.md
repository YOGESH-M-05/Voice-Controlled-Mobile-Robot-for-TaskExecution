# Voice-Controlled Autonomous Robot

## Overview
This project is a voice-controlled autonomous robot that uses **ESP32** and **Google Alexa**. The robot can navigate via **Google Maps**, avoid obstacles using **ultrasonic sensors**, and handle objects with a **servo mechanism**. It is designed for tasks such as home automation, industrial applications, autonomous delivery, and surveillance.

## Features
- **Voice Control:** Integrated with **Alexa** for remote control via voice commands.
- **Autonomous Navigation:** Navigates using **Google Maps** API for location-based movement.
- **Object Handling:** Equipped with a **servo mechanism** for precise object manipulation (picking and placing).
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** Uses **ultrasonic sensors** to detect and avoid obstacles in real-time.
- **IoT Connectivity:** Built with **ESP32** to provide cloud-based control for remote automation.

## Technologies Used
- **Microcontroller:** ESP32/Arduino
- **Voice Recognition:** Integrated with **Google Alexa**
- **Navigation:** Utilizes **Google Maps API**
- **Sensors:** **Ultrasonic sensors** for obstacle avoidance
- **Camera Module:** For path identification and real-time navigation
- **Wi-Fi Connectivity:** For cloud-based control and remote access

## Applications
- **Home Automation:** Control and automate household tasks via voice.
- **Industrial Automation:** Used in factories or warehouses for handling tasks.
- **Autonomous Delivery:** Capable of moving packages or small items automatically.
- **Surveillance:** Can be used for security or patrol tasks in various environments.
